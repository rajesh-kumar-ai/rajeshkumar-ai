### Hi, I'm Rajesh 👋

I'm a software engineer with interests in Python, AI/ML, and scalable systems.

Currently exploring open-source contribution workflows, including:
- Reading and understanding large codebases
- Writing clean pull requests
- Improving documentation and tests

I'm actively learning and contributing where I can.
